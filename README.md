Community Request Board
Team: Quarantined Coders
·       Due to the coronavirus, many states have implemented lockdowns where people are not allowed to leave their homes except for very few occasions. However, not everyone can safely leave their homes due to lack of private transportation or health-issues that makes them more susceptible to becoming ill. Thus, it’s been a trend throughout the country where local community members band together and help run errands for their neighbors.
·       Our project will be focused on creating a program that acts as a community’s public request board which lists the various requests posted by community members. Users can post their own requests (requestor) and/or mark off a request that they’ve completed for someone (contributor).
